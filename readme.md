üê∏ PEPE BOT

Tinkering with autonomous Twitter bots and AWS.

Python code that cycles through a set of images stored on an AWS S3 bucket and remembers which one it last posted by persisting the data ‚Äî ensuring that each run picks up right where the last one left off.

Uses both Twitter API v1.1 (for media upload) and v2 (for tweeting).
Runs automatically via a cron job on an AWS EC2 instance.
